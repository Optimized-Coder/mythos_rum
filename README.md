# Mythos Rum {React}
This is the landing page for a fictional rum brand, Mythos Rum, built by using React components and a modular approach to styling that I implemented to practice increasing the readability of my code. The color palate for this design was taken from a logo I made a few months ago when I envisioned this brand. 

The goal was to keep this site minimal yet effective for marketing purposes. As well as to practice building React components, the goal of this site was to also practice what I have recently been strengthening my understanding on; colour theory and typography
